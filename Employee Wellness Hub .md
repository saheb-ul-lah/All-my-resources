# Employee Wellness Hub (EWH) - User & Admin Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the **Employee Wellness Hub (EWH)**, a dedicated platform designed to support and enhance the well-being of our employees.

The EWH is a centralized system where employees can access company-provided health and wellness services, register for health events, and provide valuable feedback. For administrators, it offers a powerful and intuitive dashboard to manage all aspects of the company's wellness program, ensuring a smooth, efficient, and impactful experience for everyone.

This guide will walk you through the features available to both employees and administrators.

> **Seamless Integration with Payroll:**
> A key feature of the EWH is its direct and automatic connection with our main Payroll system. When a new employee is added to Payroll, an account is instantly and securely created for them in the Wellness Hub. This ensures that all employee data is always synchronized and up-to-date, eliminating the need for manual data entry and reducing administrative workload.
